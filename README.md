# NR-Model-Importer
Tools for importing custom models into Night-Runners.

NRMI is a version of [3DMigoto](https://github.com/bo3b/3Dmigoto) that I have modified to be compatible with Night-Runners.

&nbsp;
## Installation Instructions

1. Download the 3dmigoto .zip from [releases](https://github.com/HBK-00/NR-Model-Importer/releases/latest) and extract it. I have provided two versions:
   - "3dmigoto-NRMI.zip " is for public releases like Steam version of the game
   - "3dmigoto-NRMI-PATREON.zip " is a version for Patreon releases of the game

2. Double click "3DMigoto Loader.exe" to start the loader, then start up Night-Runners. If everything is correct so far, 3DMigoto should be injected into the game and you should see a window pop-up for key commands:

3. Installation complete! You should now be able to load custom resources and override textures and shaders with 3DMigoto. To add mods, place them in the Mods folder (one mod at a time) and press F10 to load them in game:

## Further Tweaking
The config file has Automatic Launch enabled by default. To modify this setting, open d3dx.ini in a text editor and go to line 65. You can either change the executable path or comment out the line to disable Automatic Launch.
